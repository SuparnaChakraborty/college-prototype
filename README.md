 **Course Matcher System**  

## **Project Overview**  
This application helps educational institutions streamline course scheduling by matching students with their preferred courses while considering constraints like room capacity, lecturer availability, and period conflicts.  

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Data Modeling**  
The system is built around four key data types:  
- **Lecturers** – Faculty members with specific teaching loads and availability.  
- **Rooms** – Classrooms with capacity limits.  
- **Courses** – Academic offerings that require specific lecturers and minimum room sizes.  
- **Student Requests** – Students’ ranked preferences for courses in specific periods.  

### **2. Validation System**  
To ensure fairness and efficiency, the system checks for:  
✔ Course capacity limits  
✔ Lecturer availability and workload constraints  
✔ Room size and availability  
✔ Valid student course preferences  
✔ Period conflicts  

### **3. Matching Algorithm**  
The system follows a structured approach:  
1. **Group student requests** by period.  
2. **Process each request** in the order received.  
3. **Assign students** to courses based on their ranked preferences.  
4. **Check constraints** (lecturer availability, room capacity, conflicts).  
5. **Allocate students** only when all conditions are met.  
6. **Track key metrics** like satisfaction rates and preference fulfillment.  

### **4. Analysis & Reporting**  
The system generates insights to help institutions optimize scheduling, including:  
📊 **Satisfaction metrics** – Overall satisfaction rates and first-choice fulfillment.  
📊 **Period-based breakdown** – A summary of course assignments.  
📊 **Bottleneck analysis** – Identifying overloaded lecturers or room shortages.  
📊 **Exportable reports** – Data can be saved for further analysis.  

### **5. Data Export**  
All data can be exported in JSON format for:  
✔ Integration with other systems  
✔ Backups and archiving  
✔ Advanced analysis with external tools  

## **Assumptions**  
To simplify scheduling, we assume:  
1️⃣ Students have ranked preferences (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice).  
2️⃣ Academic periods are fixed (e.g., A, B, C).  
3️⃣ Requests are processed in the order received.  
4️⃣ Students can enroll in **only one course per period**.  
5️⃣ Each course is taught by **one lecturer** and has a unique ID.  
6️⃣ Courses are **not split into multiple sections** with different instructors.  
7️⃣ Each course is assigned **one room for its entire duration**.  
8️⃣ Lecturers have **fixed availability periods**.  
9️⃣ There are **no specific time preferences** within a period.  
🔟 The system processes all requests **in a single batch** rather than incrementally.  

## **Tech Stack**  
🛠 **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
🛠 **Architecture:** Modular, with separate data handling, validation, and UI layers
